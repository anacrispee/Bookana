## Technologies & Architecture

Bookana is built on a solid technological foundation to ensure clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

* **Kotlin**
* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
* **Koin**
* **Retrofit**: Responsible for all our network requests, to consume APIs for the **book exploration** feature.
* **Room**: A data persistence library that facilitates local storage. Essential for the **saving books to the bookshelf** feature.
* **Multi-module Architecture**: The project is divided into modules. This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, facilitating collaboration and scalability.
* **Custom Gradle Plugin**: custom Gradle plugin to centralize build configurations across all modules. This prevents code duplication and standardizes the development environment.
